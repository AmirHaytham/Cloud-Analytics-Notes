# Cloud Analytics Notes
Cloud Analytics for Data-science Applications

# **Outline for Lecture 1: Cloud Introduction**

## **1. Definition of Cloud Computing**  
- Delivery of computing services over the internet.  
- Services include: storage, databases, networking, software.  

## **2. Key Characteristics of Cloud Computing**  
- **On-demand self-service**: Provision resources without human intervention.  
- **Broad network access**: Available via the internet from any device.  
- **Resource pooling**: Multiple customers share resources dynamically.  
- **Rapid elasticity**: Scale up or down based on demand.  
- **Measured service**: Pay-as-you-go pricing model.  

## **3. Service Models**  
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: Provides virtualized computing resources.  
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: Offers platforms for application development.  
- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: Delivers applications over the internet.  

## **4. Deployment Models**  
- **Public Cloud**: Shared by multiple users; accessible via the internet.  
- **Private Cloud**: Dedicated infrastructure for a single organization.  
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Combines public and private clouds.  
- **Community Cloud**: Shared among organizations with similar requirements.  

## **5. Benefits of Cloud Computing**  
- Cost efficiency (no upfront hardware investment).  
- Scalability and elasticity.  
- Disaster recovery and business continuity.  
- Accessibility and collaboration.  

## **6. Challenges of Cloud Computing**  
- Data security and privacy.  
- Downtime risks.  
- Compliance with regulations.  
- Vendor lock-in concerns.

# **Answers to Potential Questions from Lecture 1**

## **1. Define cloud computing in your own words.**  
**Answer**: Cloud computing is the delivery of various computing services (e.g., servers, storage, databases) over the internet, allowing users to access and pay for only what they use.

---

## **2. What are the five essential characteristics of cloud computing?**  
**Answer**:  
1. **On-demand self-service**: Provision resources automatically.  
2. **Broad network access**: Access services from anywhere with internet.  
3. **Resource pooling**: Shared resources for efficiency.  
4. **Rapid elasticity**: Adjust resources to match workload changes.  
5. **Measured service**: Billing based on actual usage.

## **3. Differentiate between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS with examples.**  
**Answer**:  
- **IaaS (e.g., AWS EC2)**: Provides virtual servers and storage for users to manage.  
- **PaaS (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk)**: Offers platforms for developers to deploy applications.  
- **SaaS (e.g., Google Workspace)**: Delivers ready-to-use software applications.

## **4. Explain the key differences between public, private, and hybrid clouds.**  
**Answer**:  
- **Public Cloud**: Accessible to anyone; lower cost but less control.  
- **Private Cloud**: Exclusive use for one organization; more secure.  
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Combines public and private, offering flexibility.  

---

## **5. Why is resource pooling important in cloud computing?**  
**Answer**: Resource pooling ensures efficient use of infrastructure by sharing resources among multiple users, reducing costs and enabling scalability.

---

## **6. What are the main challenges businesses face with cloud computing?**  
**Answer**:  
- **Data Security**: Risk of breaches and unauthorized access.  
- **Downtime**: Dependence on internet availability and provider uptime.  
- **Compliance**: Meeting regulations like GDPR or HIPAA.  
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Difficulty switching providers due to compatibility issues
