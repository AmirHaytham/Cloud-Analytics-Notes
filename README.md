![AMI Workflow Diagram](https://github.com/AmirHaytham/Cloud-Analytics-Notes/blob/main/AMI%20Workflow%20Diagram.png)

## **Description**

### **What is an AMI?**
- An **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)** is a pre-configured template used to launch EC2 instances.
- Includes essential components:
  - Operating system.
  - Application server.
  - Pre-installed applications.
- Eliminates the need for manual operating system installation and server setup, enabling faster deployments.

---

## **Diagram Details**

### **Top Section**:
- Demonstrates how an AMI is used to create an EC2 instance.
- The instance includes:
  - **Root Volume**: Attached storage for the instance.

### **Bottom Section**:
- Highlights the reusability of AMIs:
  1. **AMI #1**: Used to create Instance #1.
  2. **New AMI**: After modifications to Instance #1, a new AMI is created.
  3. **Reusability**: The new AMI is then used to launch additional instances.

---

## **Key Benefits of AMIs**
1. **Streamlined Instance Launching**:
   - Pre-configured templates save time and reduce manual setup.
2. **Consistency**:
   - Reusable AMIs ensure uniformity across instances.

## EC2 Lifecycle Diagram
![AMI Workflow Diagram](https://github.com/AmirHaytham/Cloud-Analytics-Notes/blob/main/EC2%20Lifecycle%20Diagram.png)

## **Description**

### **Lifecycle Phases**
Amazon EC2 instances go through several lifecycle states, each with distinct characteristics and implications for billing and resource management:

1. **Pending**:
   - The instance is in the process of launching.
   - Billing has not yet started.
   
2. **Running**:
   - The instance is active and operational.
   - **Billing begins** in this state.
   
3. **Stopping/Stopped**:
   - The instance transitions to a stopped state.
   - For EBS-backed instances:
     - Data on the root volume is retained.
     - Billing for **computing** stops, but charges for **storage** continue.
   
4. **Rebooting**:
   - A temporary restart of the instance.
   - No data is lost during this phase.
   - Billing continues without interruption.

5. **Terminated**:
   - The instance is permanently deleted.
   - Associated resources, such as storage volumes, are released (unless marked to persist).

---

## **Relevance**
Understanding the lifecycle states of EC2 instances is essential for:

1. **Cost Management**:
   - Ensure unused instances are stopped or terminated to minimize costs.
   
2. **Resource Optimization**:
   - Manage instance states efficiently to match application requirements.

3. **Data Retention**:
   - Recognize when data persists (e.g., stopped instances with EBS) versus when it is permanently deleted (e.g., terminated instances).

## VPC Network - VPC Architecture Diagram
![VPC Network - VPC Architecture Diagram](https://github.com/AmirHaytham/Cloud-Analytics-Notes/blob/main/VPC%20Network%20-%20VPC%20Architecture%20Diagram.png)

### **What is a VPC?**
- A **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** is a logically isolated network within AWS.
- Enables complete control over networking, including:
  - **Subnets**: Logical subdivisions of the VPC.
  - **Security Groups**: Act as virtual firewalls for instance-level access control.
  - **Network Access Configurations**: Define routing and internet access.

---

## **Diagram Highlights**

### **Components**:
1. **Public Subnet**:
   - Hosts resources accessible from the internet, such as EC2 instances.
   - Uses an Internet Gateway (IGW) for connectivity.

2. **Private Subnet**:
   - Isolated from direct internet access.
   - Ideal for sensitive resources like **databases** (e.g., Amazon RDS).
   - Internet access for private resources is managed via a **NAT Gateway** or **NAT Instance**.

3. **Availability Zones (AZs)**:
   - Two zones (e.g., AZ A and AZ B) are shown for redundancy and fault tolerance.
   - Resources are distributed across AZs to improve high availability.

4. **Access Control**:
   - **Security Groups**: Define inbound and outbound traffic rules for instances.
   - **Network ACLs (NACLs)**: Optional, subnet-level rules for additional traffic control.

5. **Corporate Connectivity**:
   - Integration with on-premises data centers is shown via:
     - **VPN**: Secure connections over the internet.
     - **AWS Direct Connect**: Dedicated, high-speed private connections.

---

## **Key Benefits of VPC**:

## VPC Routing Diagram - VPC Architecture with Subnets
![VPC Routing Diagram - VPC Architecture with Subnets](https://github.com/AmirHaytham/Cloud-Analytics-Notes/blob/main/VPC%20Architecture%20with%20Subnets.png)

### **Main Route Table**
- Default route table for the VPC.
- Handles **local traffic**:
  - Example: Traffic within the VPC (e.g., **10.1.0.0/16**) is routed locally.
- Does **not** allow internet access.

---

### **Custom Route Table**
- A user-defined route table with additional configurations.
- Allows **internet access**:
  - Example: Routes traffic to an **Internet Gateway (IGW)** for external communication.
  - Destination: `0.0.0.0/0` (represents all IP addresses outside the VPC).

---

## **Subnets Overview**

### **1. Public Subnet**
- Connected to the **Internet Gateway** for external access.
- Resources in this subnet (e.g., EC2 instances) are accessible from the internet.

### **2. Private Subnet**
- Isolated from direct internet access.
- Traffic remains within the VPC or uses a **NAT Gateway**   (if configured) for outbound internet access.
- **Red X**: Represents a **blocked pathway** for internet traffic directly from the private subnet.

---

## **Key Points**
1. **Main Route Table**: Restricts traffic to remain within the VPC.
2. **Custom Route Table**: Enables internet access via an Internet Gateway.
3. **Subnet Differentiation**:
   - **Public Subnet**: Internet-enabled.
   - **Private Subnet**: Internet-isolated.

---

   - Supports up to **256 IP addresses**.
   - Allows **internet access** via an **Internet Gateway**.

2. **Private Subnet**:
   - CIDR Block: `10.1.3.0/24`.
   - Supports up to **256 IP addresses**.
   - **Isolated** from the internet for hosting secure resources like databases.

---

### **Non-Overlapping Subnets**
- Both subnets are distinct subsets of the VPC's IP range (`10.1.0.0/16`).
- Ensures there is no overlap, avoiding conflicts in resource allocation.

---

### **Availability Zone**
- Both subnets are deployed in **Zone A** of the selected AWS region.
- Regional zones improve redundancy and fault tolerance for resources.

---

## **Public vs. Private Subnet**
| **Subnet Type** | **Internet Access**             | **Use Case**                      |
|------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Public**       | Yes (via Internet Gateway)     | Hosting public-facing resources like EC2 instances or web servers. |
| **Private**      | No (isolated)                  | Securely hosting sensitive resources like databases or backend applications. |

---

## VPC Region and IP Range

![AMI Workflow Diagram](https://github.com/AmirHaytham/Cloud-Analytics-Notes/blob/main/ACL%20Diagram.png)

### **Rules for Public and Private Subnets**
- Public Subnet:
  - Allow inbound HTTP/HTTPS.
  - Allow inbound SSH.
- Private Subnet:
  - Allow inbound from public subnet for application traffic.
  - Deny all other inbound traffic.

---

## ACL (Access Control List) in VPC
![ACL (Access Control List) in VPC](https://github.com/AmirHaytham/Cloud-Analytics-Notes/blob/main/ACL%20(Access%20Control%20List)%20in%20VPC.png)

### **What is an ACL?**
- A **Network Access Control List (ACL)** is a network-level security mechanism in AWS.
- Operates at the **subnet boundary**, providing an additional layer of security.
- Configured to **allow** or **deny** specific traffic based on defined rules.

---

### **Key Features**
1. **Stateless**:
   - Inbound and outbound rules are evaluated separately.
2. **Subnet-level Protection**:
   - ACLs apply to all resources within a subnet.
3. **Rule Evaluation**:
   - Rules are evaluated in numerical order (from lowest to highest).

---

## **Diagram Highlights**

### **Subnets**:
1. **Public Subnet**:
   - Used for internet-facing resources.
   - ACL rules permit inbound HTTP/HTTPS traffic and SSH access.
2. **Private Subnet**:
   - Hosts sensitive resources like databases.
   - ACL rules restrict inbound traffic, allowing only necessary communication from the public subnet.

### **Availability Zones**:
- Two zones (**A** and **B**) provide redundancy:
  - Each zone contains both public and private subnets.
  - ACLs are applied consistently across all subnets for uniform security.

---

## **Purpose of ACLs**
1. **Enhanced Security**:
   - Adds an extra layer of protection alongside **Security Groups**.
2. **Granular Traffic Control**:
   - Allows fine-tuning of allowed and denied traffic at the subnet level.
3. **Support for Multi-Subnet Architectures**:
   - Ensures secure communication between public and private subnets in multi-AZ deployments.

---

## Security Groups Diagram
![Security Groups Diagram](https://github.com/AmirHaytham/Cloud-Analytics-Notes/blob/main/Security%20Groups.png)

### **What are Security Groups?**
- A **Security Group** acts as a virtual firewall for EC2 instances.
- Controls **inbound** and **outbound traffic** for individual instances.
- Operates at the **instance level**, offering fine-grained control over traffic.

---

## **Key Features**
1. **Stateful**:
   - Automatically allows return traffic for permitted inbound or outbound requests.
2. **Instance-Level Protection**:
   - Unlike ACLs, security groups are applied directly to EC2 instances.
3. **Customizable Rules**:
   - Rules specify:
     - Allowed **ports** (e.g., 22 for SSH, 80 for HTTP).
     - Allowed **protocols** (e.g., TCP, UDP).
     - Allowed **IP ranges** or **specific IPs**.

---

## **Diagram Highlights**

### **Public Subnets**:
- EC2 instances hosted in public subnets are protected by security groups.
- Typical security group rules for public subnets:
  1. Allow inbound **HTTP/HTTPS** traffic (ports 80 and 443) from the internet.
  2. Allow inbound **SSH** access (port 22) from a specific IP range for management purposes.
  3. Deny all other inbound traffic by default.

### **Private Subnets**:
- EC2 instances in private subnets also have security groups.
- Typical security group rules for private subnets:
  1. Allow inbound traffic only from instances in the public subnet (e.g., application servers).
  2. Deny all other inbound traffic.

---

## **Purpose of Security Groups**
1. **Enhanced Instance Security**:
   - Ensures that only trusted traffic reaches EC2 instances.
2. **Customizable Traffic Control**:
   - Tailor rules to specific application requirements.
3. **Simplified Management**:
   - Rules can be updated dynamically without disrupting instance operations.
